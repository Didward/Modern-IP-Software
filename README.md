# Modern-IP-Software
This is a modern designed desktop app that displays your IP address.

There is a copy to clipboard feature which I don't think I need to explain. Honestly, this is just a small open source project I made.
It takes up some space so I don't think you should actually use it - just use a browser to search what your ip is or just check your settings.

But I mean if you want it, here! :)
