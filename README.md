# Modern-IP-Software
This is a modern designed desktop app that displays your IP address.

There is a copy to clipboard feature which I don't think I need to explain. Honestly, this is just a small open source project I made.
It takes up some space so I don't think you should actually use it - just use a browser to search what your ip is or just check your settings.

But I mean if you want it, here! :)

# How To Install
1. Download the main.py file
2. If you don't already have python then go to python.org/downloads and download the latest version
3. Go to terminal or command prompt or console (depends on your OS) and then go to the directory of where 'main.py' is
4. Type in 'pip install tkinter' and then 'pip install customtkinter', 'pip install pyperclip'. (If you get an error after trying the other steps then go to main.py and run 'pip install ____' (The blank space is the module for example when you see 'import json' json is the module)
6. Type in 'python main.py' for Windows or on MacOS and other operating systems like Linux 'python3 main.py'
7. Bam! It's running
